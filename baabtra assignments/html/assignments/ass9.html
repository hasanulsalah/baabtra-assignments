<p align="left"><font color="black">computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic and logical operators.Since a sequence ofoperations can be readily changed ,the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"> <a id="cpu">cpu</a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.[1] Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitr</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="ALU"> ALU</a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.</font></p>

<a href="#top">GO TO TOP</a></p>

<p align="left"><font color="black">A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="c">C</a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">C (/siː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems.</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="c++">C<sup>++</sup></a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms</font></p>

<h2 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="DBMS">DBMS</a></h2>

<a href="#top">GO TO TOP</a></p>

<p align="left"><font color="black">A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data format, field names, record structure and file structure. It also defines rules to validate and manipulate this data.</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="RDBMS">RDBMS</a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">RDBMS. Stands for "Relational Database Management System." An RDBMS is a DBMS designed specifically for relational databases. Therefore, RDBMSes are a subset of DBMSes. A relational database refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="OODBMS">OODBMS</a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">OODBMS stands for Object-Oriented Database Management System. An object-oriented database management system (also known simply as an object database ) is a DBMS where data is represented in the form of objects, as used in object-oriented programming.</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="HDBMS">HDBMS</a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. ... A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row in the relational database model and an entity type corresponds to a table. The hierarchical database model.</font></p>

<h3 align="left" style="color: black"><a id="NWDBMS">NWDBMS</a></h3>

<p align="left"><font color="black">A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques. The database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with .... A competing "next generation" known as NewSQL databases attempted.</font></p>
